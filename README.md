# Employee Tracker

## Description
The Employee Tracker is a Node and SQL based program that allows the user to do multiple things within tracking employees in a company. The SQL schema and seeds were developed within MySQL Workbench and transferred into VSCode where the rest of the code was developed using Inquirer and Javascript. The program is booted up by deploying Node in the terminal and navigating the options using the up and down arrow keys and hitting enter for your selection. Then, as you go through the different options, it will either prompt you with a table via the Console Table or you will be asked questions in order to update, add, or delete an employee from the system.

This project was challenging due to the module not being within full detail in order to accomplish the necessary tasks needed for this challenge. However, it taught a great lesson in asking for help when needed and to improve upon what you already know and research when you can. The most challenging aspect of this project was figuring out how to nest different code within a function in order to work properly as well as having to re-run the schema and seeds in order for something to work and having to debug.
